## yamlu - yet another machine learning utility library

### Notes

- I keep this repository for my own reference
- This is early state and can change any time
- At this point I would suggest you to just copy & paste code snippets you find useful
- Only supports python >= 3.7 (due to dataclasses)

### Setup
```
conda create -n py37-ds -y python=3.7 numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn pillow jupyterlab
conda activate py37-ds
pip install pytest
```
