## yamlu - yet another machine learning utility library

### Notes

- I keep this repository for my own reference
- This is early state and can change any time
- At this point I would suggest you to just copy & paste code snippets you find useful
- Only supports python >= 3.7 (due to dataclasses)

### Installation

```shell
pip install -U git+https://github.com/bernhardschaefer/yamlu.git
```
